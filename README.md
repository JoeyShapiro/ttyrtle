# GOALS
Maybe make this a matrix for what i like/dislike for other tools
- actually "lightweight"
  - and i dont mean that like "missing features"
  - low ram, cpu, storage, while still being powerfull
  - should get good score on doom fire
- no ai slop
- input box like Warp
  - intellisense
    - maybe use carapace
  - cursor movement with mouse
  - each command is separate
  - can copy whole command outputs
- smart ctrl+c
  - copy if text is highlighted
  - terminate if not
- quake style terminal
  - yes again, i like it
  - but have it different for each os maybe
- no login or account required
- command execution timer
  - like in vscode notebooks
- handle repeat lines like vscode debug or node
- give warning when beginning of output did a roll off
